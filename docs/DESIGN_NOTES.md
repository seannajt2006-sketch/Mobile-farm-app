# Design Notes — Farm Connect

- Follow HTML prototypes in Prototype/ for layout inspiration.
- Mobile-first, simple cards and clear CTAs for role selection, buyer lists, seller dashboard, admin approvals.
- Color palette: light neutrals with blue accents; adjust per prototype once assets are extracted.
- Navigation: stack for onboarding; potential bottom tabs for buyer views later.
- Forms: concise labels, inline validation, friendly error text.

## Open questions
- Finalize typography pairing for RN (e.g., use Expo Google Fonts?).
- Define filter/sort UX for buyer lists.
- Decide on offline/local storage needs (e.g., AsyncStorage caches).
